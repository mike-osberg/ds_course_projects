    "So for this challenge, I created a for loop over the range of the numbers we're interested in. Then, I created a list that will hold the results of dividing a given number in the range (\"p\") and all of the numbers smaller than that number down to two. Then, in the second for loop, I created a range of all of the numbers greater than 2 and less than \"p\". I called the numbers in this range q. For each number p, I divide it (modulo style) by every number smaller than p and greater than 1. I store the remainder of each of these in the aforementioned prime_test_list. The, I look at the prime_test_list and how many numbers in that list are greater than 0. If all of them are greater than 0, that means that this number is prime (because it is not divisble by any number smaller than it). That final test occurs with the prime_decision variable, which tests whether the sum of numbers greater than 0 (+2 to include the number p itself and 2) is equal to the number itself. If it is, then the number is prime and I added it to the prime_sum variable that was created at the beginning. "
